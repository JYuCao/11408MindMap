Dear Prof. Simith,

I am so glad and honor to hear that you invited our research team to participate the robotics competition of our school. After a brief disscution, we decide to join the game. Here are introduction of the main functions of our robot.

The name of our robot is Bob. He is a dog like robot which has a body, four legs and a head with eyes that are made of cameras. Bob is used to find people who get lost in ruins after disaster. Firstly, Bob's eyes are made of cameras that can distinguish people or other creatures.  In addition, Bob can hear voice around him. These two functions make Bob could quickly find people who need help. However, there is a difficulty. Bob can not move on complex ground currently. So we maybe need you professor to give some suggestions.

Above are our robot Bob's main functions and the problem we met. Looking forward to your reply. Thanks again.

Yours,

Li Ming.

Dear Prof. Smith,

I am very glad and honored to hear that you have invited our research team to participate in robotics competition of our school. After a brief disscution, we have decided to join the game. Here is the introduction of the main functions of our robot.

The name of our robot is Bob. He is a dog-like robot which has a body, four legs and a head equipped with camera sensors. Bob is designed to locate people trapped in ruins following disasters. First, Bob's cameras can distinguish humans from other objects or animals. In addition, Bob can detect voices and sounds around him. These two functions enable Bob to quickly locate people in need of help. 

However, we have encountered a difficulty. Bob can not move reliably on complex terrain. Therefore, we would greatly appreciate any suggestions you could provide, especially regarding locomotion and control strategies.

The above summarizes Bob's main functions and the issue we are facing. We look forward to hearing from you. Thanks again for your invitation and support.

Yours sincerely,

Li Ming.
